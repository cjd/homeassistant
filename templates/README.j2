# Hello there! 👋

So this is my Home Assistant instance 🎉

This repository exists mostly for my own amusement, but it may contain some things that others might find useful.

## Statistics from the instance

Description | Value
-- | --
{%- set data = namespace(domains=[]) %}
{%- for state in states %}
{%- if state.domain not in data.domains %}
{%- set data.domains = data.domains + [state.domain] %}
{%- endif %}
{%- endfor %}
{%- for domain in data.domains %}
Entities in the [`{{domain}}`](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/{{domain}}) domain | {{states[domain] | count }}
{%- endfor %}

## Hardware and general setup

Connectivity | WiFi

For the installation method of Home Assistant I went with [the generic Linux installation of Hassio](https://www.home-assistant.io/hassio/installation/#alternative-install-on-a-generic-linux-host)

This method stores the files used by hassio/Home Assistant in `/usr/share/hassio`.

## Core integrations that I use

- [Default Config](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/default_config/)
- [File](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/file/)
- [Input Boolean](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/input_boolean/)
- [Shell command](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/shell_command/)


## custom_components that I use

A summary of custom_components that I use.
{% for integration in custom_components %}
### [{{integration.name}}]({{integration.documentation}})
{% if integration.domain in custom_component_descriptions %}

{{custom_component_descriptions[integration.domain]["usage"]}}
{% endif -%}
{% endfor %}

## Custom Lovelace plugins that I use

A summary of custom Lovelace plugins that I use.

### [Compact Custom Header](https://github.com/maykar/compact-custom-header)

_CCH - Customize the header and add enhancements to Lovelace. Features: kiosk mode, conditional header styling, per user/device views, swiping between views on mobile, and more._

I use this to get more screen space by minifying the space used by the header, and to lock my laptop that I have in the hallway by the door to one view.

### [Favicon Counter](https://github.com/custom-cards/favicon-counter)

_Show a notification count badge.._

I use this to show a badge on the Home Assistant tab in my browser when there are active [Persistent notifications](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/persistent_notification/)

### [Mini Graph Card](https://github.com/kalkih/mini-graph-card)

_Minimalistic graph card for Home Assistant Lovelace UI_

I use this to create beautiful statistics cards for my UI.

Like all other Home Assistant instances this is also a Work in Progress :D
